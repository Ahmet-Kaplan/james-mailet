Release Notes
-------------
   Apache James Standard Mailets is a collection of general purpose
   mail processing agents with minimal dependencies.
   Mailets are defined by the 
   Apache Mailet API (a framework assisting the rapid development of 
   email processing functionality see http://james.apache.org/mailet). 
   
1.0
---
   This is the first independent release of this code. Previously 
   it was shipped as part of the Apache James Mail Server
   (an advanced mail server see http://james.apache.org/mailet). 
   This release is not dependent on that server but can be used in any Mailet container.
