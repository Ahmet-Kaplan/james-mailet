<section name="What is the Apache Mailet API?">
<p>
The Apache Mailet API is a Java API which allows the rapid development and flexible deployment of email processing functionality.
</p>
<p>
The Mailet API is a subproject of <a href='http://james.apache.org'>Apache JAMES</a>.
All who are interested in developing the Mailet API and JAMES will be warmly
welcomed on the <a href='mail-lists.html'>mailing lists</a>.
</p>
</section>
<section name="Getting Started">
<p>Until these pages are fleshed out, the best way to understand the API is to read the 
<a href='apidocs/index.html'>Javadocs</a> 
and look at the <a href='xref/index.html'>source code</a>. 
</p>
<subsection name='Building the Mailet API'>
<p>
The build uses <a href='http://ant.apache.org'>Ant</a>. <code>ant -projecthelp</code>
describes appropriate targets. <code>ant</code> runs the default target.
